# Git Basics - November 1, 2023

## What I Learned Today

Today I learned about the fundamental Git commands and workflow:

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository
- `git add`: Stages changes for commit
- `git commit`: Records changes to the repository
- `git push`: Uploads local repository content to a remote repository
- `git pull`: Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository

## Resources Used

- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/)

## Reflections

Understanding Git's basic workflow has made me more confident in managing my code. I initially found branching confusing, but after practicing with a few examples, the concept became clearer. Tomorrow I plan to learn more about resolving merge conflicts.
