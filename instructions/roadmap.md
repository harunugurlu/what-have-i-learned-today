## Step 2: Add Supabase to the Project (Including Authentication)

### Summary
Set up Supabase integration with the Next.js project, including authentication flow with Google Sign-In, protected routes, and database tables.

### Completed
- Verified existing Supabase setup in the project (client, server, middleware)
- Created authentication-related directories and files:
  - Login page with Google authentication
  - Auth callback route to handle OAuth redirects
  - Sign-out route for user logout
- Set up protected and public route groups:
  - Protected layout that checks for authentication
  - Public home page with redirect to dashboard for authenticated users
  - Dashboard page in the protected route group
- Created SQL migration file for database tables:
  - Users table linked to Supabase Auth
  - Colors table with default color options
  - Tags table for categorizing learning logs
  - Learning logs table for storing user entries
  - Learning log tags table for many-to-many relationships
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Added necessary assets (logo, Google logo)

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 3: Implement Basic Authentication Flow

### Known Issues
- None at this time

### Questions
- None at this time

## Step 3: Implement Basic Authentication Flow

### Summary
Enhanced the authentication flow by adding reusable components, context providers, utility functions, and email/password authentication.

### Completed
- Fixed linter errors in the authentication flow by properly awaiting the Supabase client creation
- Created authentication-related actions in `lib/actions/auth.ts`:
  - `getCurrentUser`: Function to get the current authenticated user with profile data
  - `signOut`: Function to sign out the current user
  - `updateUserProfile`: Function to update the user's profile data
- Created user-related components:
  - `UserProfile`: Component to display user information and sign-out button
  - `UserProvider`: Context provider to make user data available throughout the app
- Updated protected routes to use the new authentication components and functions:
  - Protected layout now uses the `UserProvider` to provide user data to all child components
  - Dashboard layout now uses the `UserProfile` component for consistent user display
  - Dashboard page now uses the `getCurrentUser` function to get user data
- Implemented email/password authentication:
  - Created a signup page with email, username, and password fields
  - Updated the login page to include email/password login
  - Created a forgot password page for password recovery
  - Created a reset password page for setting a new password
  - Updated the auth callback route to handle both Google OAuth and email/password signup
  - Updated the public home page to include links to both login and signup pages

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 4: UI & Design (Global)

### Known Issues
- None at this time

### Questions
- None at this time

## Step 4: UI & Design (Global)

### Summary
Implemented a light + dark theme system, set up a consistent color palette, and created shared layouts for different route groups.

### Completed

- Created shared layouts for different route groups:
  - Public layout for unauthenticated users
  - Auth layout for login/signup pages
  - Protected layout for authenticated users
  - Dashboard layout for the main application
- Added consistent header and footer components to all layouts
- Ensured responsive design for all layouts
