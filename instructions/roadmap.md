# Project Implementation Roadmap

## Step 1: Create the Data Model

### Summary
Created the base data model for the application, including the Entity interface and all required domain entities.

### Completed
- Created the base `Entity` interface with `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` fields
- Created the `User` entity with `username`, `email`, and `streak` fields
- Created the `LearningLog` entity with `userId`, `title`, `details`, and `colorId` fields
- Created the `Color` entity with `name` and `hexCode` fields
- Created the `Tag` entity with `name` field
- Created the `LearningLogTag` entity for the many-to-many relationship between `LearningLog` and `Tag`
- Created a `ServerResponse` interface for standardized API responses

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 2: Add Supabase to the Project (Including Authentication)

### Known Issues
- None at this time

### Questions

## Step 2: Add Supabase to the Project (Including Authentication)

### Summary
Set up Supabase integration with the Next.js project, including authentication flow with Google Sign-In, protected routes, and database tables.

### Completed
- Verified existing Supabase setup in the project (client, server, middleware)
- Created authentication-related directories and files:
  - Login page with Google authentication
  - Auth callback route to handle OAuth redirects
  - Sign-out route for user logout
- Set up protected and public route groups:
  - Protected layout that checks for authentication
  - Public home page with redirect to dashboard for authenticated users
  - Dashboard page in the protected route group
- Created SQL migration file for database tables:
  - Users table linked to Supabase Auth
  - Colors table with default color options
  - Tags table for categorizing learning logs
  - Learning logs table for storing user entries
  - Learning log tags table for many-to-many relationships
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Added necessary assets (logo, Google logo)

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 3: Implement Basic Authentication Flow

### Known Issues
- None at this time

### Questions
- None at this time

## Step 3: Implement Basic Authentication Flow

### Summary
Enhanced the authentication flow by adding reusable components, context providers, and utility functions to manage user authentication and profile data.

### Completed
- Fixed linter errors in the authentication flow by properly awaiting the Supabase client creation
- Created authentication-related actions in `lib/actions/auth.ts`:
  - `getCurrentUser`: Function to get the current authenticated user with profile data
  - `signOut`: Function to sign out the current user
  - `updateUserProfile`: Function to update the user's profile data
- Created user-related components:
  - `UserProfile`: Component to display user information and sign-out button
  - `UserProvider`: Context provider to make user data available throughout the app
- Updated protected routes to use the new authentication components and functions:
  - Protected layout now uses the `UserProvider` to provide user data to all child components
  - Dashboard layout now uses the `UserProfile` component for consistent user display
  - Dashboard page now uses the `getCurrentUser` function to get user data

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 4: UI & Design (Global)

### Known Issues
- None at this time

### Questions
- None at this time
